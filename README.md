This is mostly a science project, and very much a work in progress :-)

It is a simple Identity Management Synchronization engine written as a way to explore Scala and Mongo and the (now defunct)
Identity Connector Framework (ICF).



There is no GUI component. Have a look at the unit tests to get an idea of how to write synchronization scripts.


See for example:  https://github.com/wstrange/smidm/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/my2do/idm/test/SyncTest.scala
